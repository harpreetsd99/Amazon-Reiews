## Data mining on Amazon Reviews using NLP

Welcome to the data mining and sentiment analysis project. In this project, we explore the complexities of data analytics, focusing on the creation of a Co-Occurrence Network Graph, Word Cloud Visualization, and Advanced Data Preprocessing for sentiment analysis. Our aim is to extract valuable insights from a large dataset of Amazon reviews, unraveling the intricate relationships between words and preparing the data for advanced analysis. Our journey begins with an overview of the project, emphasizing the importance of extracting insights from complex datasets. We highlight key steps, including creating a Co-Occurrence Network Graph, Word Cloud Visualization, and Advanced Data Preprocessing for sentiment analysis.

### Data Exploration and Manipulation: 
We employ various methods to explore and manipulate the dataset, providing an overview of its dimensions, column names, and information. A detailed analysis of the dataset, including the distribution of Helpfulness Denominator, Helpfulness Numerator, and reviews based on star ratings. We utilize CountVectorizer to understand word frequency, creating a co-occurrence matrix to visualize word relationships.
